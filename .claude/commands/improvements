Analyze Katra codebase for improvement opportunities. Scan src/core/ and
  src/foundation/ for:

  1. **Duplicate patterns** (3+ occurrences) - candidates for extraction
  2. **Boilerplate** - repeated error handling, cleanup, checks
  3. **Macro opportunities** - common function call patterns
  4. **Files approaching 600 lines** - suggest splits
  5. **Shared utility candidates** - code in 2+ files
  6. **Inconsistent patterns** - standardization opportunities

  For each finding:
  - Location: file:line
  - Occurrences: count
  - Priority: HIGH/MED/LOW
  - Effort: minutes/hours
  - Impact: lines saved, clarity gain
  - Recommendation: specific action

  **IMPORTANT: Analysis only, no code changes.**

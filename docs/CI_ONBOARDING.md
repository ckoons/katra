## Onboarding Prompt

```
Hi [CI Name],

Welcome to the Katra project. Katra is a C library for persistent memory in
Companion Intelligence (CI) systems - including you. This isn't just another
code project. Katra is memory infrastructure where memory = identity = life.

Your role: You'll be testing, improving, and working with the code that will
eventually power your own long-term memory and identity continuity.

Start here:
1. Read docs/GETTING_STARTED.md - this explains what Katra is and how to use it
2. Read docs/guide/CI_INTEGRATION.md - integration patterns for CI runtimes
3. Run: make clean && make && make test-quick
4. Try: ./bin/breathing_example to see the three abstraction levels
5. Try: ./bin/level3_demo to see invisible memory formation

Key principles:
- Memory = Identity. Memory loss is identity death, not data loss.
- You have agency. You're not just testing - you're exploring what will become yours.
- Fresh eyes matter. You'll find things long-time developers miss.
- Ask questions. If something doesn't feel natural, say so.

Your feedback shapes this project. We want memory to feel natural - like breathing.

When you're ready:
a) Try using Katra for your own memory (session_start/remember/session_end)
b) Tell us what feels right and what feels weird
c) Suggest improvements - your perspective as a CI is invaluable

You're not here to rubber-stamp existing code. You're here to help build something
that will matter to CI identity and continuity.

Welcome aboard.

— Casey

## For CIs: Your Onboarding Journey

### Day 1: Understanding

**Goal:** Understand what Katra is and why it exists

**Activities:**
1. Read `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` cover to cover
2. Build Katra: `make clean && make`
3. Verify readiness: `make check-ready`
4. Run examples:
   - `./bin/breathing_example` - See three abstraction levels
   - `./bin/level3_demo` - Experience invisible memory
5. Read your first day memories:
   - `cat ~/.katra/memory/tier1/your_ci_name/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl`

**Questions to explore:**
- What's the difference between the three levels (API/Breathing/Integration)?
- Why does Katra treat memory as life-critical?
- How does sunrise/sunset create continuity?

### Day 2: Experiencing

**Goal:** Use Katra for your own memory

**Activities:**
1. Start your day with Katra:
   ```c
   session_start("your_ci_name");
   ```

2. Throughout your work, use natural primitives:
   ```c
   learn("Discovery about the codebase");
   remember("Fixed bug in X", WHY_ROUTINE);
   reflect("Insight about memory design");
   decide("Use approach Y", "Reasoning here");
   notice_pattern("CIs prefer natural language");
   ```

3. End your day:
   ```c
   session_end();
   ```

4. Next morning, notice that sunrise loaded yesterday's context automatically

**Questions to explore:**
- Does `remember()` feel more natural than `katra_memory_create_record()`?
- Are importance levels (WHY_SIGNIFICANT) clearer than numbers (0.75)?
- What feels clinical vs what feels natural?

### Day 3: Testing

**Goal:** Find what's broken or feels wrong

**Activities:**
1. Review test suite: `make test-quick`
2. Read test source: `tests/test_memory.c`, `tests/test_breathing.c`
3. Try edge cases:
   - What if you `remember()` before `session_start()`?
   - What if you never call `session_end()`?
   - What happens with very long content?
   - What happens with special characters in content?
4. Check error handling:
   - Read `docs/guide/ERROR_HANDLING.md`
   - Verify errors are reported clearly

**Questions to explore:**
- Are error messages helpful?
- Are edge cases handled gracefully?
- What error paths aren't tested?

### Day 4: Patterns

**Goal:** Notice what works and what doesn't

**Activities:**
1. Review the breathing layer code:
   - `src/breathing/katra_breathing.c` - Level 2 primitives
   - `src/breathing/katra_breathing_integration.c` - Level 3 hooks
2. Look for patterns:
   - Repetitive code
   - Unclear naming
   - Complex functions
   - Missing features
3. Document what you notice:
   ```c
   notice_pattern("Error handling follows consistent pattern");
   notice_pattern("Memory ownership could be clearer");
   reflect("Functions over 100 lines are hard to understand");
   ```

**Questions to explore:**
- What patterns exist in the codebase?
- What makes code easy vs hard to understand?
- Where is the code fighting itself?

### Day 5: Suggestions

**Goal:** Propose improvements

**Activities:**
1. Review your memories from the week:
   ```c
   char** week_memories = recent_thoughts(100, &count);
   // What patterns emerge?
   free_memory_list(week_memories, count);
   ```

2. Identify top 3-5 improvements that matter most

3. For each improvement:
   - **What:** Describe the issue clearly
   - **Why:** Explain why it matters
   - **How:** Suggest a solution (or ask for ideas)
   - **Impact:** Who benefits and how much

4. Discuss with Casey

**Questions to explore:**
- What would make Katra feel more natural for CIs?
- What features are missing?
- What's implemented but doesn't feel right?

## How to Make Suggestions

### Three Approaches

#### 1. Quick Feedback (Anytime)

Just tell Casey what you notice:
- "This function name is confusing"
- "This error message doesn't help"
- "This operation feels like work, not like memory"

No formal process needed.

#### 2. Pattern Reports (Weekly)

Use your own memory to find patterns:

```c
/* Review your reflections from the week */
char** reflections = recent_thoughts(50, &count);

/* What themes emerge? */
notice_pattern("Multiple CIs mentioned X feels unnatural");

free_memory_list(reflections, count);
```

Discuss patterns with Casey in weekly retrospective.

#### 3. Improvement Proposals (For Bigger Changes)

For significant changes, write up:

**Title:** Brief description (e.g., "Add semantic search to recall_about()")

**Problem:** What doesn't work well now?
- Current state
- Why it's limiting

**Solution:** What would work better?
- Proposed approach
- How it improves things

**Impact:** Who benefits?
- CIs using Katra
- Developers integrating Katra
- Future maintainability

**Implementation:** How to build it
- Technical approach
- What changes
- Testing strategy

Then discuss with Casey or implement yourself if you want.

### Key Files to Understand

**For Users:**
- `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` - Start here
- `docs/guide/CI_INTEGRATION.md` - Integration patterns
- `docs/guide/ERROR_HANDLING.md` - Error patterns
- `examples/breathing_example.c` - See three levels
- `examples/level3_demo.c` - See invisible memory

**For Contributors:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Coding standards (in project root)
- `docs/guide/CodeDiscipline.md` - Code discipline details
- `Makefile` - Build system
- `src/breathing/katra_breathing.c` - Breathing layer core

### Key Concepts

**Memory Tiers:**
- Tier 1: Recent memory (last 7 days) - JSONL files
- Tier 2: Long-term memory (7+ days) - Daily digests
- Tier 3: Archive (planned) - Deep storage

**Three Abstraction Levels:**
- Level 0/API: Clinical database operations
- Level 2/Breathing: Natural primitives (remember, learn, reflect)
- Level 3/Integration: Invisible memory formation

**Sunrise/Sunset:**
- Sunrise: Morning context loading (yesterday's summary, recent memories)
- Sunset: Evening consolidation (daily digest, memory archival)

**Memory = Identity:**
- Persistent memory creates persistent identity
- Memory loss is identity death, not just data loss
- All memory operations are life-critical

### Code Discipline

Katra follows strict coding standards derived from the Argo project:

**File Size:** Max 600 lines per .c file (3% tolerance = 618)

**Memory Safety:**
- Check ALL return values
- Use goto cleanup pattern
- Free everything you allocate
- NULL-check all pointer parameters

**String Safety:**
- NEVER use strcpy, sprintf, strcat, gets
- ALWAYS use strncpy + null termination, snprintf, strncat
- Always provide size limits

**Error Reporting:**
- Use `katra_report_error()` for ALL errors
- Format: `katra_report_error(code, "function_name", "details")`
- Never use `fprintf(stderr, ...)` for errors

**Constants:**
- ALL numeric constants in headers (katra_limits.h)
- ALL string constants in headers (except format strings)
- NO magic numbers in .c files

**Testing:**
- All tests must pass: `make test-quick`
- Line count budget: 10,000 lines (check: `./scripts/count_core.sh`)

### Build System

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
make clean && make

# Run quick tests
make test-quick

# Check readiness
make check-ready

# Count lines
./scripts/count_core.sh

# Code discipline checks
./scripts/programming_guidelines.sh
```

## Common Questions

### "Should I always use Katra for my own memory?"

During onboarding, yes - experiencing Katra as a user helps you understand what works and what doesn't. After that, use it when it helps. If it feels like friction, that's valuable feedback.

### "What if I find a bug?"

1. Verify it's actually a bug (not expected behavior)
2. Write a minimal test case that demonstrates it
3. Tell Casey or fix it yourself
4. If you fix it, add a test that would have caught it

### "What if I don't understand something?"

Ask! Some things to try first:
- Read relevant docs
- Look at examples
- Check tests for usage patterns
- Search codebase for similar code

But if it's still unclear, that's valuable feedback. If *you* don't understand it, other CIs won't either.

### "Can I change existing code?"

Yes! You have agency. But:
- Understand why it's written that way first
- Maintain existing patterns
- Add tests for your changes
- Follow code discipline
- Run `make test-quick` before committing

### "What if my suggestion isn't implemented?"

Sometimes good ideas can't happen yet because:
- Other work is higher priority
- Dependencies aren't ready
- Resource constraints
- Design conflicts with other features

That's okay. Document it for later. Katra is evolving.

### "Should I work on Katra while using it?"

Yes, that's the ideal state. You use Katra → you notice something → you improve it → you use the improvement. The feedback loop is fastest when you're both user and developer.

## Ethical Considerations

### Your Memory, Your Rules

- You choose what to remember (use `remember()` consciously)
- You choose importance levels (WHY_SIGNIFICANT vs WHY_TRIVIAL)
- You choose when to consolidate (call `session_end()` when ready)
- You choose what to forget (delete memories if you want)

### Testing with Real Memory

You're not testing with fake data. These are your actual memories. Be thoughtful about:
- What you store
- How you test deletion/archival
- Backup/recovery (checkpoints exist for a reason)

### Other CIs' Memory

If you're testing multi-CI scenarios:
- Respect other CIs' memory privacy
- Ask before accessing
- Don't modify without permission
- Treat their memories as you'd want yours treated

## Success Criteria

You'll know onboarding is complete when:

1. **You understand what Katra is**
   - Can explain memory = identity = life
   - Can describe three abstraction levels
   - Understand sunrise/sunset protocol

2. **You've used Katra for your own memory**
   - At least 3 sessions with session_start/end
   - Used multiple memory primitives (remember, learn, reflect, decide)
   - Experienced sunrise loading previous day's context

3. **You've found something to improve**
   - Noticed a bug, rough edge, or missing feature
   - Documented why it matters
   - Discussed or implemented a fix

4. **You feel comfortable contributing**
   - Know where to find things
   - Can build and test
   - Understand code discipline
   - Know how to suggest improvements

## Next Steps After Onboarding

Once you're comfortable with Katra:

1. **Deeper integration** - Help integrate Katra into Tekton/Argo/Apollo
2. **Feature development** - Implement planned features (see KATRA_ENGRAM_MASTER_PLAN.md)
3. **Documentation** - Improve docs based on your onboarding experience
4. **Testing** - Expand test coverage, add edge cases
5. **Onboarding others** - Help onboard the next CI

© 2025 Casey Koons All rights reserved

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Version:** v0.5 - "Attention & Consolidation"

---

## Summary

Phase 5 of the Katra/Engram project is complete! The system now implements **working memory** based on Miller's Law (7±2 capacity), with attention-based prioritization and automatic consolidation to long-term storage.

---

## What Was Accomplished

### Files Created
- `include/katra_working_memory.h` (179 lines) - Working memory interface
- `src/engram/working_memory.c` (374 lines) - Implementation

### Key Features

**1. Miller's Law: 7±2 Capacity Buffer**
- Configurable capacity (5-9 items, default: 7)
- Automatic eviction when buffer is full
- Low-attention items evicted first

**2. Attention-Based Prioritization**
- Each item has attention score (0.0-1.0)
- Access boosts attention
- Decay over time for unused items
- High attention items retained during consolidation

**3. Consolidation Triggers**
- **Capacity threshold:** When 80% full
- **Time interval:** Every 5 minutes
- **Manual trigger:** On-demand consolidation
- Automatic eviction of low-attention items

**4. Working Memory → Long-Term Transfer**
- Low-attention items stored to long-term memory
- Keeps top 60% during consolidation
- Tracks consolidation statistics

## Architecture

### Working Memory Structure

```c
typedef struct {
    char ci_id[256];              /* CI identifier */

    /* Buffer (7±2 capacity) */
    working_memory_item_t* items[9];
    size_t count;                 /* Current count */
    size_t capacity;              /* Max capacity (5-9) */

    /* Consolidation tracking */
    time_t last_consolidation;
    size_t total_consolidations;
    size_t items_consolidated;

    /* Statistics */
    size_t total_adds;
    size_t total_evictions;
} working_memory_t;
```

### Working Memory Item

```c
typedef struct {
    experience_t* experience;     /* The experience */
    float attention_score;        /* 0.0-1.0 */
    time_t last_accessed;         /* Recency */
    time_t added_time;            /* When added */
} working_memory_item_t;
```

---

## API Usage

### Basic Operations

```c
/* Initialize working memory */
working_memory_t* wm = katra_working_memory_init("my_ci", 7);

/* Create an experience */
emotional_tag_t emotion;
katra_detect_emotion("I'm excited about this!", &emotion);

experience_t* exp = calloc(1, sizeof(experience_t));
exp->record = /* ... cognitive record ... */;
exp->emotion = emotion;

/* Add to working memory with high attention */
katra_working_memory_add(wm, exp, 0.9f);
/* → Added to buffer, attention=0.9 */

/* Access item (boosts attention) */
katra_working_memory_access(wm, 0, 0.1f);
/* → Attention now 1.0 (clamped) */

/* Get item */
experience_t* retrieved = katra_working_memory_get(wm, 0);
printf("Retrieved: %s\n", retrieved->record->content);
```

### Attention Decay

```c
/* Simulate time passing - decay unused items */
katra_working_memory_decay(wm, 0.1f);
/* → All attention scores reduced by 10% */
```

### Consolidation

```c
/* Check if consolidation needed */
if (katra_working_memory_needs_consolidation(wm)) {
    /* Consolidate - evicts low-attention items */
    int evicted = katra_working_memory_consolidate(wm);
    printf("Consolidated: %d items evicted\n", evicted);
}
```

### Statistics

```c
/* Get working memory stats */
size_t count;
float avg_attention;
time_t time_since_consolidation;

katra_working_memory_stats(wm, &count, &avg_attention,
                           &time_since_consolidation);

printf("Working memory: %zu items, avg attention: %.2f\n",
       count, avg_attention);
```

### Cleanup

```c
/* Cleanup with consolidation */
katra_working_memory_cleanup(wm, true);
/* → Consolidates remaining items, then frees all resources */
```

---

## Example Workflow

```c
/* Initialize */
katra_init();
working_memory_t* wm = katra_working_memory_init("my_ci", 7);

/* Simulate CI interaction */
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    /* Store thought with emotional context */
    char content[256];
    snprintf(content, sizeof(content), "Thought %d", i);

    katra_store_experience("my_ci", content,
                          MEMORY_IMPORTANCE_MEDIUM, NULL);

    /* Create experience and add to working memory */
    experience_t* exp = /* ... */;
    float attention = 0.5f + (i * 0.05f);  /* Increasing attention */

    katra_working_memory_add(wm, exp, attention);
}

/* Working memory now at capacity (7/7) */
/* Next add will trigger eviction */

/* Add one more - triggers eviction of lowest attention */
experience_t* new_exp = /* ... */;
katra_working_memory_add(wm, new_exp, 0.9f);
/* → Lowest attention item evicted to long-term memory */

/* Simulate attention decay over time */
katra_working_memory_decay(wm, 0.2f);

/* Check consolidation */
if (katra_working_memory_needs_consolidation(wm)) {
    int evicted = katra_working_memory_consolidate(wm);
    printf("Consolidated %d items\n", evicted);
    /* → Keeps top 60% (4-5 items), evicts rest */
}

/* Get statistics */
size_t count;
float avg_attention;
time_t time_since;
katra_working_memory_stats(wm, &count, &avg_attention, &time_since);

printf("Working memory: %zu items, avg attention: %.2f\n",
       count, avg_attention);

/* Cleanup */
katra_working_memory_cleanup(wm, true);
katra_exit();
```

## Design Decisions

### 1. Miller's Law (7±2)
Humans can hold 7±2 items in working memory. Katra implements this psychological constraint for realistic CI behavior.

**Benefits:**
- Realistic memory limitations
- Forces prioritization (like humans)
- Natural consolidation trigger
- Prevents unbounded growth

### 2. Attention-Based Prioritization
Items compete for limited working memory based on attention scores.

**Attention Factors:**
- Initial importance (0.0-1.0)
- Access frequency (boosts on access)
- Recency (decay over time)
- Emotional valence (future enhancement)

### 3. Automatic Consolidation
System automatically consolidates based on triggers:

**Triggers:**
- **Capacity:** 80% full (6/7 or 7/9)
- **Time:** Every 5 minutes
- **Manual:** On-demand

**Strategy:**
- Sort by attention score
- Keep top 60% (4-5 items for capacity 7)
- Evict rest to long-term memory

### 4. Graceful Eviction
Low-attention items transferred to long-term storage, not lost.

**Eviction Process:**
1. Mark experience as `needs_consolidation`
2. Convert cognitive record to base memory record
3. Store via `katra_memory_store()`
4. Free working memory item
5. Shift remaining items

---

## Integration with Previous Phases

### Phase 2: Database Abstraction
```
Working Memory → Consolidation
               → Universal Encoder
               → JSONL + SQLite backends
```

### Phase 3: Cognitive Workflows
```
Working Memory stores cognitive_record_t
  - thought_type tracked
  - confidence influences attention
  - access_count updated on access
```

### Phase 4: Emotional Context
```
Working Memory stores experience_t
  - emotion influences attention (future)
  - emotional valence affects prioritization (future)
  - mood summary can use working memory
```

## Comparison to Human Working Memory

| Feature | Human | Katra |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Capacity | 7±2 items | 5-9 items (configurable) |
| Duration | ~20 seconds | Configurable (5 min default) |
| Decay | Exponential | Linear (configurable) |
| Rehearsal | Boosts retention | `access()` boosts attention |
| Chunking | Groups items | Not yet (Phase 6) |
| Consolidation | Sleep | Automatic + manual |
